## What is the Knowledge Base?

The Knowledge Base is a collection of financial information that Foracle's AI Assistant can search through when you ask questions. Think of it as a "brain" of financial knowledge that helps the assistant give you accurate, helpful answers.

When you ask a general financial question, the assistant searches this knowledge base to find relevant information before responding.
